node_modules -> place where installed package code is downloaded 
package.json -> dependencies -> the package on which project is dependent on 
        ^4.19.2 -> 4  -> major -> breaking changes are there 
                   19 -> minor -> push features that are backward compatible 
                   2  -> patch -> small change/bug fix
                   ^  -> automatically updated to 4.x.x (allowing to auto update)
                   ~  -> allows updates to the patch version only (4.19.x)

Whenever a request is coming it starts matching from starting of the code -> order of writing routes matters 

ROUTES- 
/ab?c -> this means b is optional in route
/ab+c -> this means any number of b can be there
/ab*cd -> this means u can write anything b/w ab and cd(must start with ab and end with cd)
/a(bc)?d -> this means bc is optional 
/a(bc)+d -> this means any number of bc can be there
/a/ -> this means anywhere a letter should be there
/.*fly$/ -> this means it should end with fly(anything can be there in starting)
/user?userId=101 -> userId can be get using console.log(req.query)
/user?userId=101&password=testing -> userID and password can be get using console.log(req.query)
/user/101 or /user/707 -> dynamic routing can be achieved using -> 
        app.get("/user/:userId", (req, res) => {
                console.log(req.params) -> this will console userID:707
                res.send({ firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" });
        });
/user/707/swati/testing
        app.get("/user/:userId/:name/:password", (req, res) => {
                console.log(req.params) -> this will console userID:707, name:'swati', password:'testing'
                res.send({ firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe" });
        });
